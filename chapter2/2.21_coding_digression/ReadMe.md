As a major theme of this book is the need to be able to program well, let’s take a short
digression and explore one of the examples from a moment ago: writing a number as a
sum of four squares. We’ll give two short programs to compute the number of ways of
representing an integer as a sum of four squares $`a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2`$ with $`a \leqslant b \leqslant c \leqslant d`$.
